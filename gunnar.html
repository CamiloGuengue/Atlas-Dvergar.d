    </div>
    <div  id="texto-izq-1" class="texto-izquierdo">
        Oldest origin: Contrary to the belief that they are created,
        in their creation myth, the Dvergar originally emerged as
        maggots from the rotting flesh of the primordial giant Ymir.
    </div>
    <div id="texto-izq-2" class="texto-izquierdo">
        Divine intervention: The gods (Odin, Vili, and Vé) gave these worms intelligence
        and human (or dwarf) form, causing them to emerge from the earth and rocks.
    </div>
    <div id="texto-izq-3" class="texto-izquierdo">
        Master Smiths: Besides Thor's hammer Mjölnir, the Dvergar crafted
        some of the most important magical objects in mythology, many of them
        as forced gifts or wagers.
    </div>
    <div id="texto-izq-4" class="texto-izquierdo">
        Dökkálfar (Dark Elves): In some sources, the Dvergar are
        closely related to or even considered the same as
        the Dökkálfar, who live in darkness (as opposed to the Ljósálfar, the Light Elves).
    </div>
    <div id="texto-izq-5" class="texto-izquierdo">
    Svartálfaheim: The world of the Dvergar is often identified with Svartálfaheim
    (the "Home of the Dark Elves" or "Home of the Dark Folk"), an underground realm.
    </div>

    <div id="texto-der-1" class="texto-derecho">
        The Völuspá: The prophetic poem Völuspá (part of the Poetic Edda)
        contains a section that is essentially a long catalog of dwarven names,
        listing dozens of them (including Dvalin, Durin, Fili, Kili, etc.).
        This underscores their importance in Norse cosmology.
    </div>
    <div id="texto-der-2" class="texto-derecho">
        Meanings: Many of their names are related to concepts such as death,
        wit, darkness, or stones and caves (e.g., Dvergar means "those who are
        from the rocks").
    </div>

    <div id="texto-der-3" class="texto-derecho">
        The Ring of Andvaranaut: Some dwarves were obsessed with wealth. The story of Andvari
        (a dwarf transformed into a fish) is famous. He cursed his magic ring, Andvaranaut, which ensured
        wealth to its possessor, so that it would bring misfortune and death to whoever wore it. This curse
        is central to the Nibelung saga.
    </div>
    <div id="texto-der-4" class="texto-derecho">
        Daytime Hazard: The most famous quirk is that the Dvergar
        must avoid sunlight at all costs.
        If the light of dawn reaches them, they turn to stone. 
    </div>
    <div id="texto-der-5" class="texto-derecho">
        Literary Source: This rule is perfectly illustrated in the poem
        Alvíssmál from the Poetic Edda, where Thor tricks the dwarf Alvíss
        (who wanted to marry his daughter) with a game of riddles until the sun rises, petrifying him.
